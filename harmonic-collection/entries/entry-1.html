      <h1>Double-Skin Milk</h1>
      <img src="../img/double-skin-milk.jpg" >
      <p>Double-Skin Milk originated in Shunde, Guangdong Province at first, approximately during the Qing Dynasty. The Shunde area is rich in water buffaloes. The milk has a high fat content and a rich taste. The locals have derived many special desserts from this kind of milk, among which double-skin milk is included. The reason why double-skin milk is called "Double Skin" is that it naturally forms two layers of milk skin during the production process. Because people in Shunde pay great attention to diet, double-skin milk has gradually become the local "signature dessert". It is even called one of the "Three Treasures of Shunde" (shunde-style Fish Sashimi, Jun 'an Steamed Whole Pig, double-skin milk).</p>
