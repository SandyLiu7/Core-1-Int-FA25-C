      <p style="color: var(--color-secondary);">Rock Sugar Poached Pear is a traditional Chinese sugar water. It has a refreshing and smooth taste, with a natural fruity aroma and a slightly sweet rock sugar fragrance. The main ingredient, pear, is cold in nature and can moisten the lungs, relieve coughing, generate body fluids and clear heat. Tremella fuciformis is rich in plant gelatin and has the effects of nourishing Yin, beautifying the complexion and moistening dryness. Red dates and wolfberries can tonify qi and nourish blood, and balance the overall cold and cool nature. The entire bowl of sugar water is smooth in the mouth and rich in gelatin, making it suitable for drinking in autumn and winter to relieve dryness and dry cough. It is not merely a dessert, but more like traditional "food therapy" - satisfying the taste buds while also emphasizing the balance and maintenance of the body.</p>
