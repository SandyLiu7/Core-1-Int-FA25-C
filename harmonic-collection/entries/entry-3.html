    <h1>Cantonese Herbal Sweet Soup</h1>
    <img src="../img/QBL.jpg" >
   <p>Cantonese Herbal Sweet Soup is one of the traditional sweet soups in Guangdong, originated from the Lingnan region, and is especially popular in summer. The words "qing", "bu" and "liang" in its name represent three major characteristics: clearing heat and relieving summer heat, nourishing the body and having a refreshing taste when entering the mouth. Common ingredients include lotus seeds, lily bulbs, red dates, coix seed, silver ear fungus, longan, polygonatum, etc. They are not only food ingredients but also commonly used medicinal and edible products in traditional Chinese medicine. Cantonese Herbal Sweet Soup emphasizes a balanced combination. It is neither too cold to hurt the stomach nor causes internal heat like traditional tonics. It can not only serve as a dessert to cool off in summer but also as a daily food therapy for nourishment and health preservation. Therefore, it has become a common classic in Cantonese sweet soup shops and households.
